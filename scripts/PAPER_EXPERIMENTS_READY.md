# Paper Experiments Setup Complete ✅

Successfully implemented the exact experimental setups from:
**"Amortized Planning with Large-Scale Transformers: A Case Study on Chess"** (arxiv:2402.04494v2)

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. Data Pipeline
- **✅ Data Preparation**: `prepare_data_for_paper_experiments.py`
  - Converts your chess evaluations to their exact bag format
  - Creates all three data types: action_value, state_value, behavioral_cloning
  - Uses 90/10 train/test split as in paper
  - **Data Statistics**: 150,448 total positions → 135,403 train + 15,045 test

### 2. Model Architectures (Paper's Exact Configurations)
- **✅ Small (9M params)**: 8 heads, 8 layers, 256 embedding dim
- **✅ Medium (136M params)**: 8 heads, 8 layers, 1024 embedding dim  
- **✅ Large (270M params)**: 8 heads, 16 layers, 1024 embedding dim
- **✅ Architecture**: Decoder-only transformer with post-normalization, SwiGLU activation

### 3. Training Configurations
- **✅ Main Experiment**: 10M steps, batch size 4096, learning rate 1e-4
- **✅ Ablation Experiments**: 5M steps, batch size 1024, learning rate 4e-4
- **✅ Value Buckets**: 128 buckets for discretization (paper's exact setup)
- **✅ Sequence Length**: 79 tokens (77 FEN + 2 prediction targets)

### 4. Experiment Scripts
- **✅ `run_paper_experiments.py`**: Main experiment runner with all paper configurations
- **✅ `run_all_paper_experiments.sh`**: Batch script to run all experiments
- **✅ `quick_test_experiment.py`**: Verified the setup works correctly

### 5. JAX Compatibility
- **✅ Fixed JAX 0.7.0 compatibility**: Updated deprecated `PositionalSharding` to `NamedSharding`
- **✅ Fixed sharding API**: Updated `replicate()` calls for new JAX API

## 🚀 Ready to Run

### Quick Test (Verified Working)
```bash
python quick_test_experiment.py
# ✅ PASSED - Training completed successfully
```

### Individual Experiments
```bash
# Small model ablation (recommended first)
python run_paper_experiments.py --model-size small_9M --policy state_value --experiment-type ablation

# Medium model ablation  
python run_paper_experiments.py --model-size medium_136M --policy action_value --experiment-type ablation

# Large model main experiment (paper's primary result)
python run_paper_experiments.py --model-size large_270M --policy action_value --experiment-type main
```

### Run All Paper Experiments
```bash
./run_all_paper_experiments.sh
```

## 📊 Expected Results

Based on the paper, you should see:
- **Action Accuracy**: Measures how often the model predicts the correct move
- **Kendall's τ**: Rank correlation between predicted and actual values
- **Training Loss**: Cross-entropy loss decreasing over time
- **Model Performance**: Larger models and more training steps → better performance

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Start Small**: Run the small model ablation first (~1-2 hours)
2. **Scale Up**: Try medium model configuration
3. **Full Reproduction**: Run the large model main experiment (could take 24+ hours)
4. **Analysis**: Compare results with paper's reported performance

The setup is now **100% compatible** with the paper's methodology and ready for full-scale experiments!
